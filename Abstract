E â€“ Returning system is an integrated system, designed to impart library book returning system in an effective and hustle free way. 
It helps students to return their books faster without the supervision of librarian and also is an alternate for manual fine collection. 
This integrated system consists of display, barcode reader, money storage vault and book storage vault. 
The application software is developed in such a way that it takes restricted input from the user and gets them through the screen. 
 
Basically, this application takes book code as the input and matches it with the pre-stored details in the database and displays the user incase of fine else accepts the book and disposes into book storage vault. 
Our one of the focuses is to reduce the manual efforts and also the chaos created in providing the exact change during fine collection. 
So, we have included hustle free change-exchange feature. 
When user has to pay the fine, he/she can deposit it at the deposit port and then system carries out image processing for detecting the cash say coins/notes. 
After determining the value of coins/notes deposited respective validations will be performed.
